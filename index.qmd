abstract: |
  The One Health approach promotes collaboration across disciplines to enhance the health of humans, animals, plants, and the environment. The Quadripartite organizations, which include the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH), and the World Health Organization (WHO), developed the One Health Joint Plan of Action (OH JPA) to support countries in achieving One Health. This plan consists of six action tracks, each consisting of a set of actions for implementing One Health. By requiring knowledge on zoonotic diseases (tracks 2 and 3), food and agriculture (track 4), antimicrobial resistance (track 5), and environmental health (track 6), most of these tracks directly concern biodiversity. However, there are currently no indicators for monitoring the OH JPA. Our research examines the extent to which all six tracks are covered by the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (KM-GBF) of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), which contains many indicators at the intersection of biodiversity and health. We assessed (1) the link between each indicator of the KM-GBF and human, animal, plant, and environmental health and (2) the usability of these indicators for monitoring One Health actions. We found that 75% of indicators are associated with health, and that a similar proportion can be used for monitoring One Health actions. Overall, our work aims to strengthen collaboration between the CBD Secretariat and the Quadripartite Organizations by highlighting the need for shared data, policy, and governance practices.

# Introduction

- The One Health approach
  - Interconnection between human, animal, plant, and environmental health
  - Zoonotic diseases, non-communicable diseases, food safety, antimicrobial and antiparasitic resistance, climate change, pollution
  - Collaboration across disciplines

- The One Health Joint Plan of Action 
  - Quadripartite Organizations
  - 6 action tracks, many actions, even more activities
  - No indicators

- The Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework
  - Convention on Biological Diversity
  - Protecting biodiversity by working towards targets and goals
  - Global Action Plan recognizes that biodiversity is linked with health 

- Monitoring framework of the KM-GBF
  - Types of indicators (headline, binary, component, complementary)
  - Many indicators are linked with health (examples)
  - Reusing indicators decreases the workload of countries

- Objectives of our study 
  1. Assess the link between biodiversity indicators and human, animal, plant, and environmental health 
    - Strengthens the link between biodiversity and health 
    - Reinforces the need for collaboration across disciplines
    - Highlights the need for shared policy and governance practices between the CBD Secretariat and the Quadripartite Organizations
  
  2. Evaluate the usability of indicators for monitoring One Health actions
    - Highlights the need for data sharing between Parties, organizations, and other stakeholders
    - Reduces the workload on countries

# Evaluation of indicators

- Qualitative assessments
  - Total of 204 indicators
  - Two evaluators for each indicator
  - Assessments based on expert knowledge
  - Finding a consensus between the evaluators

## Assessing the link between biodiversity indicators and health

- Qualitative assessments
  - Assessing the link between each indicator and human, animal, plant, and environmental health
  - Direct connection if there is a direct causal relationship between the indicator and health (e.g., the indicator could directly measure the state or a risk factor of health) 
  - Indirect connection if there is a single intermediary factor between the indicator and health
  - Potential connection if there are two or more intermediary factors between the indicator and health, or if they are likely connected but we are not sure how
  - No connection if the connection between the indicator and health is far-fetched, unlikely, or absent
  - Require categorizing species and defining health

- Categorizing species within One Health 
  - Animals 
    - Include pets, livestock, fisheries, and aquaculture, i.e. species currently looked after by veterinarians and food inspectors
    - Exclude humans and wildlife 
    - Are taken care of by the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH)
  
  - Humans
    - Are taken care of by the World Health Organization (WHO)

  - Plants
    - Include species used for food, fuel, and medicine, i.e. cultivates plants 
    - Are taken care of by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)

  - Environment 
    - Includes ecosystems and all species not considered in the human, animal, or plant categories
    - Includes forestry and fisheries
    - Being taken care of by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)

- Defining health
  - Human and animal health
    - Overall wellbeing of an individual, i.e. the extent to which it is able to function physically, mentally, and behaviorally 
    - Diseases are deviations from the normal functioning of an individual, often leading to pain, suffering, and death

  - Plant health 
    - The extent to which an individual is able to function physically
    - Diseases are deviations from the normal physiological functioning of an individual, often leading to death
  
  - Environmental health
    - The extent to which the environment is able to function, maintain biological and chemical processes, and adapt to change 
    - Disturbances are degradations that lead to a decline in the functioning of ecosystems and biological communities
    - Environmental health include wildlife health

## Assessing the usability of indicators for monitoring the OH JPA

- Qualitative assessments
  - Evaluating each action track independently
  - Identifying the main action that can be monitored for each relevant action track
  - Directly usable indicators can already be used to monitor an action in the action track
  - Indicators usable after adaptation need to be slightly modified (e.g., changes in scale of measurement, data resolution, or taxa) before being used to monitor an action in the action track
  - Not usable indicators need to be greatly modified before being used to monitor the actions in the action track, or they monitor something outside the scope of the action track

# Link between biodiversity indicators and health

- Most indicators are linked with health
  - How many indicators are directly or indirectly linked with human, animal, plant, and environmental health?
  - Description of Figure 1
  - Examples of indicator linked with human, animal, plant, and environmental health

![Figure caption.](figures/link_health.png)

- Link between biodiversity and health
  - The state of biodiversity impacts health
  - Ecosystem services benefit health
  - Biodiversity and health have similar pressures
  - Biodiversity and health are protected with similar actions

# Usability of indicators for monitoring the OH JPA

- Most indicators can be used to monitor the OH JPA
  - How many indicators for each action track?
  - Description of Table 1
  - Description of Figure 2
  - Importance of directly reusing indicators
  - Indicators usable after adaptation are based on similar and robust methodologies, which minimizing training requirements
